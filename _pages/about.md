I am a PhD student at the State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing (LIESMARS), Wuhan University (https://liesmars.whu.edu.cn/). My research interests include high-performance geospatial computing, remote sensing workflows, and geospatial large language models.
